# The Noble Foodie
The Noble Foodie is a website that I put together showing a few recipes. I enjoy cooking and trying
different paletes. However, I put together my three top favorite dishes. It's
 interactive because it allows the users to like the recipe that is shown. The receipes are descriptive
 and easy to follow.
