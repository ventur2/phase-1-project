# The Noble Foodie
The Noble Foodie is a website that I put together showing a few recipes. I enjoy cooking and trying
different paletes. However, I put together my three top favorite dishes. It's
 interactive because it allows the users to like the recipe that is shown. The receipes are descriptive
 and easy to follow. 

### Requirements and Installation
Copy and paste this `url` (https://github.com/ventur2/phase-1-project) into your browser. Fork and
 clone the **SSH key** into your terminal using the command `git clone (url).` After, use the command `code .` 
 to open the file in your prefered code editor. Also must have json server installed.

## Usage
To begin, type `json-server --watch db.json` in your terminal.
For MAC users, type `open index.html` in your terminal and for Windows users, type `explorer.exe index.html` 
in your terminal.
